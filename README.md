The repo contains 4 files:
1. ML_project_report.pdf - this is the report for the project
2. ML_project.ipynb - this is the coding part of the project
3. nba2k15_player_ratings.csv - dataset of player ratings
4. shot_logs.csv - dataset of all shots

- The python jupyter notebook uses !wget comman to download the datasets from this repo.

- If you would want to run the ML_project.ipynb including the model training parts, there is a variable RUN_FINE_TUNING inside the second cell that first needs to be set to True.
